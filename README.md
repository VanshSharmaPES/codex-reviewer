# AI Bug Detector

A GitHub App that performs automated, AI-powered code review on Pull Requests. It parses code structurally (not just as text), reasons about it using an LLM, and posts inline review comments on the exact lines where issues are found.

**Live:** Deployed on Vercel · **Languages supported:** C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

## What it does

When a Pull Request is opened or updated, AI Bug Detector:

1. Receives the event via a GitHub webhook (signature-verified)
2. Parses the changed files into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using `tree-sitter`
3. Runs a lightweight rule engine over the AST to surface structural hints (e.g. suspicious patterns worth flagging to the model)
4. Builds a prompt combining the raw diff, AST context, and rule hints
5. Sends it to an LLM (Groq / Llama 3.3 70B, with OpenAI-compatible fallback) and validates the structured JSON response against a schema (Zod)
6. Maps each finding back to its exact line in the diff and posts an inline PR comment

Detected issue types include memory leaks, race conditions, null dereferences, and injection vulnerabilities.

## Why structural parsing instead of pattern matching

Regex-based review tools match text, not code. A rule like "flag `strcpy` calls" using regex has no way to know if that call is inside a comment, a string literal, or genuinely reachable code — it just matches the substring. Parsing into an AST means the tool understands actual code structure: scope, control flow, and where a given variable is declared versus used. That's the difference between a lint rule that fires on real bugs and one that mostly produces noise.

## Why an async job queue instead of handling requests synchronously

GitHub expects a webhook response within a few seconds, or it treats the delivery as failed and retries — which would trigger duplicate analysis of the same PR. An LLM call over AST + diff context can easily take longer than that window. So the webhook handler does the minimum needed to acknowledge receipt (verify signature, enqueue the job, return 200 immediately), and a separate BullMQ worker processes the job asynchronously against Redis. This also provides retry-on-failure without re-triggering the webhook, and a natural point to add backpressure if many PRs arrive at once.

## Repository Convention Reviewer CLI

The project also includes a local TypeScript/JavaScript convention-review workflow. It profiles a base repository to learn evidence-backed conventions, verifies a patch against a post-change copy, and reports only newly introduced deviations. The current CLI supports deterministic conventions such as naming style, import order, function length, and exported-code documentation; optional LLM-generated patterns are stored as advisory evidence rather than treated as automatic violations.

```bash
npm run conventions:profile -- --repo fixtures/convention-base --out fixtures/profile.json
npm run conventions:review -- --base fixtures/convention-base --repo fixtures/convention-change --profile fixtures/profile.json --patch fixtures/convention-change.patch
```

Pass `--fixes auto` to request up to three structured AI-generated unified diffs for the detected convention violations. Each generated diff is applied in an isolated temporary copy, reparsed, checked against the original rule, and rejected if it introduces another convention violation or touches an unrelated location.

The review command compares three inputs: `--base` is the repository used to learn conventions, `--repo` is the post-change repository, and `--patch` identifies the changed lines. This prevents pre-existing violations outside the patch from being reported as new findings. Use `--llm-patterns` when profiling to add optional, evidence-grounded advisory patterns; deterministic findings do not require an AI key.

### CLI exit codes

- `0`: profile/review completed with no enforceable violations.
- `1`: review completed and found one or more violations.
- `2`: invalid arguments, profile, patch, or output path.
- `3`: no eligible source file could be analyzed.

### Development checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:conventions
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

The fixture workflow is deterministic and does not require Redis, GitHub credentials, or an AI provider. AI-generated fixes are never applied to the user’s working tree automatically; they are validated in an isolated temporary copy first.

## How Codex and GPT-5.6 were used

Codex, using GPT-5.6, was used as a development collaborator for architecture review, implementation planning, code generation, test creation, and local verification of the repository-convention CLI. It helped structure the code into typed, independently testable modules and validate the profile-and-review flow against fixtures.

Codex and GPT-5.6 are not part of the application’s runtime review pipeline. Runtime AI analysis continues to use the configured Groq or OpenAI-compatible provider; project decisions, review of generated changes, and final integration remain human-directed.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VanshSharmaPES/AI-Bug-Detector.git
cd AI-Bug-Detector
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in GITHUB_APP_ID, GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET, GROQ_API_KEY, REDIS_URL
```

Requires a registered GitHub App (Pull requests: Read & Write, Metadata: Read-only, Webhooks subscribed to PR events) with its private key saved as `private-key.pem` in the project root.

```bash
docker-compose up --build   # Redis + Next.js server + worker, containerized
```

or run components separately: `redis-server`, `npm run dev`, `npm run worker`.

### Vercel deployment checks

Before deploying, run `npm run build` locally. The production build requires the direct `tree-sitter` dependency declared in `package.json`; Vercel will also fail the build when JSX text contains unescaped apostrophes or quotes. Redis is required by the webhook/worker path, but the convention-review CLI and the static frontend build do not require a local Redis server.

## Roadmap

- Professional UI refinement for the dashboard and review experience, with a distinctive visual system and polished states

- Interactive "Suggested Changes" (auto-fix commits, not just comments)
- Codebase-aware RAG — semantic cross-file context so findings account for related code beyond the diff
- Web dashboard for review history and telemetry
